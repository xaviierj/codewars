// Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.

// Created a function that takes a integer and doubles it and returns it

function doubleInteger(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Double it and return it.
      i =  i * 2
    return i;
  }
  console.log(doubleInteger(5))

  //Ex. If i = 5 it would return 10.
